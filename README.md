This is a simple prototype we could use for our service. A basic homepage and a php form.
The form exports the content to a csv file which we could then use for the recommendations.

What we need to do now is to 
1. improve the form to include all the info we need.
2. start with the java mahout application
3. the application then could export its recommendations into another csv file of which we could then display into a simple html page.

Nada:
I'll try to finish what we need on the front-end now.
